// a trait is similar to an interface (especially with Java 8's default methods) that can also contain fields
// in fact, a trait is almost the same as an abstract class except for two things:
// 1. a trait cannot have any constructors
// 2. a class or trait can extend multiple traits, but only a single class
// also note the square brackets syntax for generics, and the use of A instead of T as the usual generic type
// we can ignore the + in the type for now, but essentially it allows Bag[B] to be a subclass of Bag[A] if B is a
// subclass of A
trait Bag[+A] extends Iterable[A] {
  // generics are sometimes hard to get right. in order to support subtypes of Bag[A], we need to accept a supertype of A
  def add[A1 >: A](item: A1): Bag[A1]

  // lambda function syntax
  def remove(p: A => Boolean): Bag[A]

  def map[B](f: A => B): Bag[B]

  def flatMap[B](f: A => Bag[B]): Bag[B]

  def filter(p: A => Boolean): Bag[A]

  // Scala's optional type is Option instead of Optional
  def reduce[A1 >: A](acc: (A1, A1) => A1): Option[A1]

  // 0-arg methods can leave off parenthesis, though this is normally only done for side-effect-free methods
  // also, when declaring a method with no parenthesis, callers must also not use parenthesis.
  // if empty parenthesis were declared here, then callers would have the option of not using them (confusing!)

  // by naming this method "apply", we can call it as one of two ways:
